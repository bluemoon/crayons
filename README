pyPaint is a 2d drawing library with gtk support. This is built off a modified nodebox codebase,
the majority of all the code is modified, very little if any of the interface is kept. Documentation coming soon.

Install:
  # cd ext/aggdraw
  # sudo python setup.py install
  # cd ../..
  # sudo python setup.py install

  
Aggdraw modifications:
  # support for quadratic and cubic beziers.
