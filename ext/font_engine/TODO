- implementation of other parts of the Freetype 2 API

- replace the usage of FT_Glyph_To_Bitmap with another function that works 
  also with non-scalable fonts

- type Glyph:

  o allow  access to attributes of the "sub-types" FT_OutlineGlyph and
    FT_BitmapGlyph ? This is a design question: Currently, we have only the 
    glyph format which is "native" for the affected font, and we convert 
    this data into a bitmap by invoking the constructor ft2.Bitmap(). 
    This is probably enough for an "abstract" interface.
  o implement FT_Glyph_Get_CBox

- support for Multiple Master fonts

- implement the specific APIs specific to TrueType, Type 1 etc ???

- create directly PIL Image objects for rendered glyphs.
